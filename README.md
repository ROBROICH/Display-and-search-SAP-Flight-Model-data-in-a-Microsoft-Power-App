# üõ´ Hands-on tutorial:  Display and search SAP Flight Model data in a Microsoft Power App. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Introduction 
The scope of this hands-on tutorial is a detailed description about the creation of a low-code canvas app for displaying tabular data from an SAP NetWeaver system. 

To stay consistent with the recent demo-scenarios in this GitHub repository, the [SAP Flight Model](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw70/7.0.31/en-US/cf/21f304446011d189700000e8322d00/content.htm?no_cache=true) sample application was selected. 
This tutorial is built on top of the existing blog of Sameer Chabungbam and is intended to give a more detailed step-by-step description for new users of Microsoft Power Apps. 


It is recommended to read the blog before starting the implementation of this tutorial. 

[Introducing the SAP ERP connector | Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-sap-erp-connector/)

The result of this hands-on tutorial will be a canvas app which displays flight data and provides the option to filter by an airline using a text field. 

The SAP data will be fetched by calling the SAP Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) "BAPI_FLIGHT_GETLIST". 

A detailed description of the BAPI can be found here:
[BAPI_FLIGHT_GETLIST SAP ABAP Function Module - Find list of flights (se80.co.uk)](https://www.se80.co.uk/sapfms/b/bapi/bapi_flight_getlist.htm)

To implement the scenario four major steps are required: 
*  Preparation of demo environment  
*  Install and configure on-prem gateway 
*  Create instant cloud flow 
*  Create canvas app 

![Overview development tasks](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Intro_Creation_Tasks.png?raw=true)

From an architectural perspective four components are required for the implementing the scenario:

* SAP Netweaver system
* On-premise data gateway
* Power Automate Flow 
* Power App canvas app

## üë©‚Äçüíª Prerequisites and demo environment setup 

Typically, productive customer tenants apply policies and rules for the configuration of the Power App and connection to the on-premise data gateway. 

To limit the dependencies to productive environments, this example describes how to setup a dedicated Microsoft Power App demo environment, which includes and assumes the usage a dedicated SAP Netweaver demo system as well. 

The availability of a demo SAP Netweaver system is the prerequisite for this scenario. 
Typically the fastest and most convenient way to provision SAP demo systems is the usage of [SAP Cloud Appliance Library images](https://cal.sap.com/catalog#/solutions). 

These steps are required to configure the Power App demo environment: 
* Joint the M365 developer program and maintain the administrator users credentials. 
    * [Microsoft 365 dev center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365)
* Create a Power Platform trail environment using the M365 administrator user 
    * [About trial environments - Power Platform | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/trial-environments) 
    * The deployed trail environment should look as displayed here in the Power Platform Admin center: 
        ![Admin center](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Configuratin_AdminCenter.png?raw=true)

* Install an on premise data gateway on a virtual machine with network access to the SAP system (see prerequisite described here [Introducing the SAP ERP connector | Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-sap-erp-connector/))
    * Please use the M365 developer program administrator user for the registration of the gateway 
    * Choose the same Azure region as the Power App tenant is deployed at 
    * [What is an on-premises data gateway? | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem)
    * [Download and install SAP .NET Connector 3.0 SDK from SAP on the on-premises data gateway VM(SAP user required)](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html)
    
After successful installation and registration, the on-premise data gateway should be able to connect to the Power Apps and Power Automate services and be visible in the Power Apps portal: 
![on-premises data gateway 1](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Configuration_DataGateway.png?raw=true)

## Instant cloud flow implementation
The first implementation step is the creation of an instant cloud flow in the Power Apps portal. 
This instant cloud flow will create the connection to the SAP Netweaver system and fetch the data by calling the SAP BAPI. 

* Select Flows -> Instant cloud flow 
![Instant Cloud Flow](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow.png?raw=true)

* As trigger select ‚ÄúPower Apps‚Äù  
![Select Power App](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_SelectPoweApp.png?raw=true)

* Click on ‚ÄúNew step‚Äù, search for ‚ÄúSAP‚Äù and select ‚ÄúCall SAP function‚Äù.   
![Select Call SAP function](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_SelectSAPFunction.png?raw=true)

* The next step is to maintain the SAP connection parameters: 
    * Your SAP Application Server host or IP
    * SAP Client ID
    * SAP System number 
    * The specific SAP function name which is __BAPI_FLIGHT_GETLIST__ for this demo scenario.

* To maintain the BAPI, the function specific parameters will be available for selection and maintenance. Please Click in ‚ÄúAirline‚Äù text field and select ‚ÄúAsk in PowerApps‚Äù to later pass the Airline search parameter from the canvas app to the BAPI. 
* Limit the maximum rows to 100 by maintaining the corresponding field max_rows in the BAPIs parameters. 
![Maintain Call SAP function](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_MaintainSAPFunction.png?raw=true)

* After maintaining the parameters, the next steps is to the test and execute the function by clicking on ‚ÄúTest‚Äù in the right top corner. The test is primarily required to collect the schema information of the BAPIs result set. 
![Test Call SAP function](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_TestSAPFunction.png?raw=true)

* Next to successfully executing the flow and calling the BAPI, please copy and save the content of the text box ‚ÄúFLIGHT_LIST‚Äù as template for the following schema maintenance.

* Subsequent saving the schema information, please add a HTTP response as next step in the flow. 
![Select HTTP response](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_HTTP_response.png?raw=true)

* Select the FLIGHT_LIST as body 
![Select HTTP response body](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_HTTP_response_body.png?raw=true)

* And generate the schema by copying the previously saved BAPI return parameters(__saved FLIGHT_LIST schema__) and then selecting ‚ÄúGenerate from sample‚Äù 
![Select HTTP generate sample](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_HTTP_response_Json.png?raw=true)
![Select HTTP generate payload](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/Flow_InstantCloudFlow_HTTP_response_Json_payload.png?raw=true)


* Now please save and close the flow configuration, the next step now is the creation of the canvas app. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Creation of the canvas app
Next to successfully implementing the flow to call the SAP BAPI, the following building block is the creation for the canvas app.  

* To start the implementation, select ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù -> ‚ÄúCanvas app from blank‚Äù 
![Canvas app create](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_Create.png?raw=true)

* Next to creating the canvas app, select the tab ‚ÄúAction‚Äù and the ‚ÄúPower Automate‚Äù icon and choose the recently created flow as shown in the screenshot 
![Canvas app select flow](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_Flow_Selection.png?raw=true)

* Insert a button and maintain the following formular for the button __"ClearCollect(queryResults,FLOW_GET_SFLIGHTS.Run(txtInputAirline.Text))"__

Remark: The formular will shown an error until the next step, adding and renaming the text-input, is done. 
The formular will create a collection which will be later referenced by the table control
![Canvas app submit button](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_Submit_Button.png?raw=true)

* Add a text input control and rename it to ‚ÄútxtInputAirline‚Äù and change the value to ‚ÄúLH‚Äù (Airline Lufthansa)
![Canvas app text input](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_TextInput.png?raw=true)

* Add a data table (preview)
![Add data table](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_InsertDataTable.png?raw=true)

* Now maintain the queryResult collection, maintained in the submit button formular, as data source for the data table
![maintain queryResult collection](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_DataTable_DataSource.png?raw=true)

* Finally select relevant column names to display in the table 
![maintain table column](https://github.com/ROBROICH/Display-and-search-SAP-Flight-Model-data-in-a-Microsoft-Power-App/blob/main/img/CanvasApp_DataTable_ColumnNames.png?raw=true)

* As last optional step the colours or the look and feel of the general canvas app could be adjusted to the users preferences or corporate style-guide. After tweaking the UI, the application is ready to be tested and the result should look similar to this screenshot

## üë©‚Äçüíª Summary
üôè First, many thanks for reading the article until here and hopefully the implementation of the demo went smoothly and was successful. üôè

Ideally this example demonstrated the easiness of creating SAP specific user interfaces with Microsoft Power Apps. 

As always, please maintain an issue for this project in case of any feedback or suggestions for improvements. As well feel free to fork and enhance the project for you own purposes. 


As outlook and based on feedback and priorities, there are current plans to extend the scenario with the write back of user inputs to the SAP system.  Another option would be triggering a Power Automate Flow from Microsoft PowerBI or demonstrating a [RPA playbook]https://flow.microsoft.com/de-de/blog/rpa-playbook-for-sap-gui-automation-with-power-automate-api-flows-ui-flows-and-power-automate-desktop/). 

Please feel free to contact the author in case of any ideas or use-cases required as tutorial.
